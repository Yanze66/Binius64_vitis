# Binius64_vitis

Binius64 is one of the most efficient zero-knowledge proof system currently due to its hardware-friendly properties, i.e., it operates over the extended binary field. However, the reference repository is build with Rust, which is safe, but may not be convenient for transting to other platform. Hence, this repository is trying to construct the Binius64 on the latest generation of FPGA platform, Versal, to benchmark and evaluate the performance.    The details of Binius64 can be found in their official portal, which is attached in reference.
